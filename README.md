# Wholemeal

Wholemeal is a fun and simple app to help you discover unique meal combinations, making it easier to decide what to eat and ensure youâ€™re getting your daily veggies.

## Why Wholemeal?

I built Wholemeal because I was having trouble coming up with things to eat. This project makes meal planning more enjoyable and helps you generate new ideas for balanced meals.

## Features

- **Food Slot Spinner:** Randomly generates meal combos consisting of a protein, carb, and veggie.
- **Saved Combos Receipt:** View all your saved meal combinations in a receipt-style list.
- **Custom Food Items:** Add your own proteins, carbs, and veggies to personalize your options.
- **Easy Navigation:** Use swipe gestures (on mobile) and keyboard shortcuts (on desktop) for quick navigation and actions.
- **Copy & Share:** Easily copy your meal combos or send them via email.
