When using your edit_file tool, DON'T USE OVERWRITE - Prefer edit instead. It's better to make multiple small edits, than one massive one. Also, it's helpful to read the section of the file you want to edit with the read_file tool and specifying the start_line and end_line.

Make sure to use the new syntaxe for event handling in svelte (ex. ontouchstart instead of on:touchstart)
